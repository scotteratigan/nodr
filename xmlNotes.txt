Room description:
<style id=""/><preset id='roomDesc'>You are before the Northeast Gate of the Crossing, surrounded by wayfarers and adventurers also in mid-journey.  Above, guardsmen stare down from the thick stone wall that encloses the city, wary for hostile visitors.  Whether they travel to destinations in town or farther west, or to the north and east, they all appear to be seeking something beyond themselves.</preset>  You also see a massive horse-drawn carriage, a weathered roadsign, a bucket of viscous gloop and a narrow footpath.
Obvious paths: <d>north</d>, <d>east</d>, <d>southeast</d>.
