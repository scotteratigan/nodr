# nodr

Node Client for Simutronics Games

To install:
clone the repo

> npm install

create a '.env' file in the following format:

ACCOUNT=YOURACCOUNT
PASSWORD=hunter2
INSTANCE=DRF
CHARACTER=Zoha

Not sure if case sensitivity matters. DRF is TF, DR is Prime, etc.

Then, once you're all set up:

> node connect

And then enjoy the magic of an extremely basic terminal window!
More good stuff to come.
